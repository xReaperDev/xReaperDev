-👋 Hi, I am a Technical Artist who spends most of his days coding or 3D modeling something of personal interest usually in Unity or Blender.
- 👀 I love the Toon/Science-Fantasy/Surrealism Genre.
- 🌱 I code and 3D model more then I draw so I'm currently trying to develop a habit of drawing.
- 💞️ I’m always down for GameJams and linking up with like minded devs.
- 🎮 Favorite games include Hollow Knight, Smash Ultimate and Touhou Hisoutensoku. 
- 📫 If you want to know more about me or my projects, email me(ReaperDev@waivable.net) or you can just browse around my sites(waivable.net). I'm sure you'll like something ♥
